/* Recap ✏ 
1- There are values, and then there’s code;
2- There are two categories of values: there are Primitive Values, and then there are Objects and Functions. In total, there are nine separate types
3 - Some values are lonely. For example, null is the only value of the Null type, and undefined is the only value of the Undefined type. As we will learn later, these two lonely values are quite the troublemakers!
4 - We can ask questions with expressions;
5 - We can inspect the type of something by wrapping it in a typeof expression.
